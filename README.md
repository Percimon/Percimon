<h1 align="center">Hello there! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h3 align="center">My name is Vlad, I'm a C# Developer with 3 years' experience. Nice to meet you!</h3>

Nowadays I create standalone applications and plugins for different BIM ((B)uilding (I)nformation (M)odeling) software and small web-applications for data management and communication between structural engineers.

Technologies that I use:
<ul>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>WPF / ASP.NET Core Razor Pages / ASP.NET Core Web API</li>
  <li>SQL (MysSQL, SQLite)</li>
</ul>

Unfortunately, due to my company security policy I can't upload most of my code to public repositories, but I share with glimpse of it here.

Other profiles:
<ul>
  <li>Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/percimon</li>
  <li>Codewars: https://www.codewars.com/users/Percimon</li>
</ul>

Also I like to create small and simple games in Unity:
