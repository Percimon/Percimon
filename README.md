<h1 align="center">Hello there! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h3 align="center">My name is Vlad, I'm a C# Developer with 3 years' experience. Nice to meet you!</h3>

Currently I develop standalone applications and plugins for different BIM ((B)uilding (I)nformation (M)odeling) software and small web-applications for data management and communication between structural engineers.

Technologies that I use:
<ul>
  <li>C# (mostly, C#8)</li>
  <li>WPF (with MVVM pattern) or ASP NET Core Web Api + UI frameworks</li>
  <li>SQLite</li>
</ul>

Unfortunately, due to my company security policy I can't upload most of my code to public repositories, but I share with glimpse of it here.
